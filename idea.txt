      and todo features, white noise music.

   * Music Appication
   * I am planning to make music player app using tkinter for gui and  yt api for music player and db
     to store metadata of the music.
   * Tikinter can be used to make guis.
   
 -----------------Subas's Ideas------------------------
   
   * Course student management system
   * 3 levels of login - User, Teacher, Login
   * Teacher can add course
   * User can enroll in Course
   * 

 -------------------FINAL-------------------------------
 The team will be making a course management application. The application will fetch API from a django based web application.
 It will allow students to log in and check the status of their courses, their teachers and all other data. 
 For further improvements, we will be making a video based course section.
